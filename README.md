### üí° Understanding Structured Visual Outputs

Vision Language Models (VLMs) like GPT4-Vision and Claude Vision excel at question-answering over visual inputs. However, for automation and integration, we need structured, strongly-typed outputs. VLM Run provides this through predefined schemas for different visual domains. Let's look at an example:

#### Example: Financial Presentation Analysis

#### Structured JSON Output
```json
{
  "description": "The slide presents a 'Differentiated Operating Model' for Selective Insurance, detailing their unique field model, franchise value, and distribution network. It also includes a pie chart showing the 2023 Net Premiums Written, with a total of $4 Billion distributed across different lines of insurance.",
  "title": "Differentiated Operating Model",
  "page_number": 7,
  "plots": [
    {
      "type": "pie",
      "title": "2023 Net Premiums Written",
      "description": "A pie chart showing the distribution of net premiums written by Selective Insurance in 2023, totaling $4 Billion. It is divided into three categories: Standard Commercial Lines (79%), Standard Personal Lines (10%), and Excess and Surplus Lines (11%).",
      "data": "| Category | Percentage | \n| --- | --- | \n| Standard Commercial Lines | 79% | \n| Standard Personal Lines | 10% | \n| Excess and Surplus Lines | 11% |",
      "caption": null
    }
  ],
  "tables": null,
  "others": [
    {
      "data": "### Unique, locally based field model\n- Locally based underwriting, claims, and safety management specialists\n- Proven ability to develop and integrate actionable tools\n- Enables effective portfolio management in an uncertain loss trend environment\n\n### Franchise value distribution model with high-quality partners\n- Approximately 1,550 distribution partners selling our standard lines products and services through approximately 2,650 office locations\n  - ~850 of these distribution partners sell our personal lines products\n  - ~90 wholesale agents sell our E&S business\n  - ~6,400 distribution partners sell National Flood Insurance Program products across 50 states\n\n> \"Everyone with Selective makes our customers feel like the #1 priority. The ease of working with Selective is unmatched.\" - Selective Agent",
      "caption": null,
      "title": null
    }
  ]
}
```

Let's unpack some of the keys in the JSON output above:

<details>
<summary><kbd>"others.data" (formatted)</kbd></summary>

### Unique, locally based field model
- Locally based underwriting, claims, and safety management specialists
- Proven ability to develop and integrate actionable tools
- Enables effective portfolio management in an uncertain loss trend environment

### Franchise value distribution model with high-quality partners
- Approximately 1,550 distribution partners selling our standard lines products and services through approximately 2,650 office locations
  - ~850 of these distribution partners sell our personal lines products
  - ~90 wholesale agents sell our E&S business
  - ~6,400 distribution partners sell National Flood Insurance Program products across 50 states

 "Everyone with Selective makes our customers feel like the #1 priority. The ease of working with Selective is unmatched." - Selective Agent

<summary><kbd>"plots.data" (formatted)</kbd></summary>

| Category | Percentage |
| --- | --- |
| Standard Commercial Lines | 79% |
| Standard Personal Lines | 10% |
| Excess and Surplus Lines | 11% |

</details>

As you can see from the JSON output above, the structured output is designed to be human readable and parseable (with [Pydantic](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic) / strongly-typed data-structures) for downstream workflow automation. The output is also designed to be easily integrated with traditional databases like Postgres, MongoDB, or even tabular databases like Airtable, where the columns can be automatically mapped to elements in the schema.


### üîå Database Integration Examples

The structured outputs from VLM Run are designed to work seamlessly with traditional databases. Our examples demonstrate:

- Storing and indexing structured visual data alongside raw data
- Going beyond simple embeddings with hybrid search capabilities
- Combining structured and unstructured data for advanced retrieval
- Real-world integration patterns with popular databases
